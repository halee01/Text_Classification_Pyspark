This project implements a classification model using PySpark to predict categories based on various features of blood donor data. The pipeline includes preprocessing the dataset, feature engineering, and building a machine learning model using decision tree classification. This approach demonstrates the use of distributed data processing with PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently.
