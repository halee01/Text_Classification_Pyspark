This project implements a classification model using PySpark to predict categories based on various features of blood donor data. The pipeline includes preprocessing the dataset, feature engineering, and building a machine learning model using decision tree classification. This approach demonstrates the use of distributed data processing with PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently.
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts donor categories (e.g., donor type, health conditions) based on features like age, gender, and various biochemical parameters (e.g., ALB, ALT, CHOL).
